                    <p>The tournament was organized by our school, and it was the annual programme of the school that lasted for two days. On the third day, it was the prize-giving ceremony. There were several matches and a good number of students took part in those competitions. However, the excitement of the spectators was noteworthy and probably the most important aspect of this tournament.</p>
